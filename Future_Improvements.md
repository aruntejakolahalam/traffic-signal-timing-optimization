# Future Improvements

- Extend the model to support real-time traffic data and adaptive signal control.
- Incorporate additional factors such as pedestrian crossings and public transport priority.
- Scale the analysis to larger urban networks with multiple interconnected intersections.
- Apply machine learning techniques to predict congestion patterns.
- Integrate the optimisation model with traffic simulation tools.
- Develop a dashboard to visualise traffic performance before and after optimisation.
