# Optimization of Traffic Signal Timing for Urban Intersections

## Overview
This project focuses on optimising traffic signal timings at urban intersections to improve
traffic flow, reduce congestion, and minimise overall delay. Using data-driven techniques,
the analysis explores how signal timing adjustments can enhance intersection efficiency and
support smarter urban traffic management.

## Key Analysis Areas
- Modelling urban intersections using network and adjacency representations
- Analysis of traffic flow patterns across connected intersections
- Optimisation of signal timing parameters to reduce congestion
- Evaluation of performance using training and testing datasets
- Simulation and analysis using Python-based workflows

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Network and graph-based data analysis
- Data preprocessing and analytical modelling
