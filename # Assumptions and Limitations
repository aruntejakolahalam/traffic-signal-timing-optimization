- Traffic flow data is assumed to be accurate and representative of real urban conditions.
- The model focuses on selected intersections and does not cover an entire city network.
- External factors such as accidents, weather, and pedestrian flow are not considered.
- Optimisation results are based on historical and simulated data.
- Real-time signal adaptation and live sensor data are outside the scope of this analysis.
