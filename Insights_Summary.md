# Insights Summary

- Optimising traffic signal timings significantly improves traffic flow at urban intersections.
- Network-based modelling helped capture dependencies between connected intersections.
- Adjusted signal timings reduced congestion and average waiting time compared to static settings.
- Data-driven optimisation proved more effective than manual or fixed-time approaches.
- The use of adjacency matrices enabled structured representation of intersection connectivity.
- Results highlight the potential of analytical methods in supporting smart traffic management.
